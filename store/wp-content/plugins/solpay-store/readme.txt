== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why are we building on Solana? =

We’re building a quick and easy way for merchants who are using ecommerce platforms to integrate with Solana Pay. We believe Solana Pay is the killer app of Solana because of low gas fees and the rapid settling and finalization of transactions. Most people have an a-ha moment the first time they scan a QR code and pay for a real product.

= What Solpay.store is about? =

The project is exactly what the name says, a quick and easy way to integrate Solana Pay into your online store. We’ve built a plugin that integrates into WooCommerce stores in less than a minute. After, the merchant is ready to accept payments via Solana Pay. Right now it is a WordPress plugin, but we are ready to develop it for all the other ecommerce platforms such as Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, Salesforce and others.
